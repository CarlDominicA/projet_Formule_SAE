Good day,


Thank you for your interest in our products.

The gen4-ESP32-70CT requires Arduino-ESP32 core v3.x which is currently pre-released. If you haven't already, please use this board package.

The current status of this release can be found on 3.0.0 Release · Arduino ESP32 Core Project Roadmap (github.com)

You can find the releases here: Releases · espressif/arduino-esp32 (github.com)

For your convenience, here's the URL that you need to add for the board package:

https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/releases/download/3.0.0-alpha3/package_esp32_dev_index.json


You'll also need to use a different version of our library which can be downloaded from GitHub and installed manually in Arduino IDE.

When the updated board package is officially released, we'll also release our updated library to Arduino Library Registry.


Best Regards,
